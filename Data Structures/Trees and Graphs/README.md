# Trees and Graphs

1. __Route Between Nodes:__ Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between two nodes.
2. __Minimal Tree:__ Given a sorted (increasing order) array with unique integer elements, write an algorithm to create a binary search tree with minimal height.
3. __List of Depths:__ Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth (e.g., if you have a tree with depth D, you'll have D linked lists).
