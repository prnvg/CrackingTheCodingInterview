# Arrays and Strings

1. __Is Unique:__ Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?
2. __Check Permutation:__ Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.
3. __URLify:__ Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with "%20". You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)
